In August 2024, I created my own basic website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## GOAL

The goal was to introduce a few series that I enjoyed watching, focusing on the theme of series. Additionally, I aimed to learn the basic syntax of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to work with the components of the web by directly setting up text, icons, names, and more.

## DESCRIPTION

I adopted the MPA (Multi-Page Application) approach so that when users perform specific interactions (such as clicking a button), they can navigate to designated pages and view the information they desire. To prevent the dullness of text-only content, I inserted images of each series and linked to official or reference sites so users can obtain additional information. I implemented a comment feature on the web page using [DISQUS](https://disqus.com/) and enabled direct communication between users and the developer (myself) using [TAWK](https://www.tawk.to/). Additionally, I deployed the project using GitHub Repositories, allowing anyone to access the web from anywhere.

## CONCLUSION

The UI and content of [the website](https://hyunsolchoi.github.io/my-first-web) are somewhat lacking, but it was very useful for learning WEB. Additionally, this experience provided me with more motivation to continue studying web development.

## REFERENCE

This project was completed based on the materials from [opentutorials](https://opentutorials.org/course/1).
