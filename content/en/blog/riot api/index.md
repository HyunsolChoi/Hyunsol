title: Using Riot API with WPF
date: 2024-09-22

In February 2022, I studied WPF and API in advance to prepare for the Windows programming lecture scheduled to take. 

## GOAL

The goal was to implement user information in JSON format to allow information retrieval by ID using the [Riot API](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis).

## Diffrences

A website that implements the feature is [OP.GG](https://www.op.gg/). However, I used WPF to implement that feature. Therefore, you don't need any web browsers, and you can use it only with programs. 

And there are no restrictions received from any web server like op.gg, refreshing was more free within the range supported by the API and faster.

## Result

The implementation of UI is not perfect, but we successfully implemented information inquiry through ID.
