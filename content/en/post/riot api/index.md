<p>
In February 2022, I studied WPF and API in advance to prepare for the Windows programming lecture scheduled to take.
</p>

### Goal

<p>
The goal was to use the <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/apis">Riot API</a> to retrieve user information by ID, providing the information in JSON format.
</p>

### Diffrences

<p>
A website that implements the feature is <a href="https://www.op.gg/">OP.GG</a>. However, I used WPF to implement that feature. Therefore, you don't need any web browsers, and you can use it only with programs. <br><br>

And there are no restrictions received from any web server like op.gg, refreshing was more free within the range supported by the API and faster.
</p>

### Result

<p>
The implementation of UI is not perfect, but I successfully implemented information inquiry through ID.

</div>
