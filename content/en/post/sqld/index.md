<p>
I studied for the SQLD certification based on my skills in SQL and knowledge of data modeling.
</p>

### GOAL

<p>
I aimed to pass the 54th SQLD exam, which will be held on August 24, 2024.
</p>

### 설명

<p>
SQLD is a nationally recognized certification administered by the <a href="https://www.dataq.or.kr/www/main.do">Korea Data Agency</a>. SQLD stands for SQL Developer, which refers to a developer who has the ability to directly access, manipulate, and develop databases using SQL. The exam assesses SQL skills based on knowledge of data modeling. There are no specific eligibility requirements, and the passing criteria for the exam are a total score of 60 points and at least 40% in each subject.
</p>

### Overview

<p>
In the previous semester, I took a database course where I learned the basics of data modeling and how to use SQL. While considering how to apply what I had learned in the course for review, I discovered the SQLD certification and promptly registered for the exam and began studying. I supplemented my theoretical knowledge by purchasing <a href="https://www.hdatalab.co.kr/">a private theory book</a>. Since the exam does not provide any previous exam questions, so I studied using  <a href="https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000212021705">practical question book</a>, and reviews from previous candidates. After much effort, I finally completed the exam and passed with a high score of 90.
</p>

### Conclusion

<p>
I believe that the certification may not significantly contribute to a development position, but it was a great opportunity to review databases and learn about the areas I was lacking. As I studied databases, I found the certification to be manageable in terms of difficulty, making it a satisfying experience overall.
