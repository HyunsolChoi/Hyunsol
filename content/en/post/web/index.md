<p>
In August 2024, I created my own basic website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
</p>

### GOAL

<p>
The goal was to introduce a few series that I enjoyed watching, focusing on the theme of series. Additionally, I aimed to learn the basic syntax of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to work with the components of the web by directly setting up text, icons, names, and more.
</p>

### DESCRIPTION

<p>
I adopted the MPA (Multi-Page Application) approach so that when users perform specific interactions (such as clicking a button), they can navigate to designated pages and view the information they desire. To prevent the dullness of text-only content, I inserted images of each series and linked to official or reference sites so users can obtain additional information. I implemented a comment feature on the web page using. I implemented a comment feature on the web page using <a href="https://disqus.com/">DISQUS</a> and enabled direct communication between users  and the developer (myself) using <a href="https://www.tawk.to/">TAWK</a>. Additionally, I deployed the project using GitHub Repositories, allowing anyone to access the web from anywhere.
</p>

### CONCLUSION

<p>
The UI and content of <a href="https://hyunsolchoi.github.io/my-first-web">the website</a> are somewhat lacking, but it was very useful for learning WEB. Additionally, this experience provided me with more motivation to continue studying web development.
